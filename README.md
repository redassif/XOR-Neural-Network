# XOR-Neural-Network
This problem serves to solve the XOR problem, through a neural network built from scratch. It gives the option between stochastic and batch training. It is visible for this case that the batch training is more efficient in its training. At the end, the program prompts the user to enter values for the the two inputs (as in the XOR truth table).
